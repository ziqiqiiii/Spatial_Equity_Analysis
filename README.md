# 🧭 Geospatial Machine Learning for Equitable Access to Sports and Active Mobility in Singapore

*A data-driven, AI-enhanced spatial analysis of sports facilities and cycling networks to uncover inequities and support healthier, more inclusive urban planning in Singapore.*

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

This project investigates whether **sports facilities and cycling paths are equitably distributed** across Singapore relative to **demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, income)** and **sports participation rates**.  
By integrating **open government data**, **geospatial analysis**, and **machine learning**, the project quantifies inequity in access to active-living infrastructure and proposes **data-driven recommendations** for future facility planning.

**Core Research Question:**
> Are sports facilities and cycling paths equitably distributed relative to demographics and participation rates (by age, ethnicity, sex, and income)?

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives

1. **Measure spatial access** to sports facilities and cycling paths across all Planning Areas (PAs).  
2. **Assess equity** — whether low-income, minority, or ageing populations experience lower access or participation.  
3. **Model participation behavior** using geospatial machine learning to uncover environmental and social drivers.  
4. **Identify “facility deserts”** and **recommend optimal locations** for new sports hubs or cycling connectors.  
5. **Support Singapore’s policy goals** under Smart Nation, Healthier SG, and the Green Plan 2030.

## ⚙️ Methods and Workflow

### 1. Spatial Preprocessing
- Standardize coordinate reference (SVY21 EPSG:3414)  
- Point-in-polygon joins (facilities → PA)  
- Line-polygon intersections (cycling paths → PA)  
- Calculate per-capita and per-km² access metrics

### 2. Spatial Analytics
- **Accessibility metrics:** facility-to-population ratio, PCN km/km²  
- **Equity metrics:** Location Quotient (LQ), Gini, Theil  
- **Spatial clustering:** Moran’s I, Getis-Ord Gi* hotspot maps  
- **Needs-adjusted residuals:** access predicted by demographics → identify underserved zones

### 3. Geospatial Machine Learning
- Predict **sports participation rates** using:
  - Random Forest / XGBoost  
  - Causal Forest (for heterogeneous treatment effects)
  - SHAP analysis for feature importance
- Spatial cross-validation to prevent geographic leakage
- Interpret residuals to detect structural inequity

### 4. Visualization
- Choropleth maps of facility & PCN access  
- Lorenz curves of inequality  
- Hotspot maps of “facility deserts”  
- SHAP plots (feature influence)  
- Equity Priority Index map combining low-access + low-income + low-participation

### 5. Spatial Optimization (Future Phase)
- Genetic Algorithm / MCLP to suggest new facility or cycling hub sites  
- Optimize for coverage, equity, and cost
